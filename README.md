# python-challenge
In the PyPoll assignment, I used Python to analyze a set of poll data and determine the total number of votes cast,a complete list of candidates who received votes,the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote. I also exported the results to a text file. 

In the PyBank assignment, I used Python to analyze a company's financial records and determine the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount and average of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,the greatest increase in profits over the entire period and the greatest decrease in profits over the entire period. I also exported the results to a text file
